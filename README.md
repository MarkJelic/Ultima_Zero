Akalabeth: World of Doom

## History
This game has the proud history of being the predecessor to the Ultima series of games. It has been packaged as Ultima 0. There's a lot out on the web about this game, which I will summarise here at a later date.

## Project
Instead of using the original Apple II version, I started with Nanochess's GW-BASIC port. This made an easier port to BBC BASIC 3 on the Agon Light. There are some changes to screen layout and control keys in the main game, however, the rest is largely untouched other than the changes needed to convert the version of BASIC as well as the platform. 

## Status
So far it seems to mostly work as expected, so I'm sharing it. I expect there will be some bugs, and of course it could be improved with more colour and the addition of sound.
